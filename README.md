# Real-Time-Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System-with-door-lock
This repository showcases a Facial Recognition Attendance Management System integrated with a door lock mechanism developed using Raspberry Pi 4 and related hardware components. The system employs advanced facial recognition algorithms to authenticate and identify authorized individuals. Upon successful recognition, it marks their attendance with name, date, and time in a CSV file, granting access through a relay lock for a specific duration. Notably, the system is designed to prevent unauthorized access attempts, ensuring security and accuracy in attendance management. Explore the code, hardware configurations, and documentation to delve into the functionalities and potential applications of this robust system.
